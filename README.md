# An Interactive Educational Website
The goal is to create an educational website with interactive slides, media contents, and a quiz to teach a concept, theory, or technique. Target audience is high school student

My topic is about the great cola war which teaches the history and fun facts of Coca Cola and PespiCo. 

I use **React**, **Material UI**, **React Slick**, and **ChartJS** to gather, organize, and visualize the information and build this website with interactive slides and a quiz to test audiences' soda knowledge.

* Skills Demonstrated: *UI Development*, *Responsive Web Design*, *Data Visualization*, and *Motion Design*.
